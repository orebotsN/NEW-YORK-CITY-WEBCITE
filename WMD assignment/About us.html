            <h1>History of the City </h1>
                <p>The rich and highly populated New York City we know now didn't become one of the biggest cities over night.It's rich history dates bask as far as the 16th Century.
                    The first native New Yorkers were the Lenape, a group of people who hunted, fished and farmed in the area between the Delaware and Hudson rivers.
                    Europeans began to explore the region at the beginning of the 16th century–among the first was Giovanni da Verrazzano, an Italian who sailed up and down the Atlantic coast in search of a route to Asia–but none settled there until 1624. That year, the Dutch West India Company sent some 30 families to live and work in a tiny settlement on “Nutten Island” (today’s Governors Island) that they called New Amsterdam.
                    In 1626, the settlement’s governor general, Peter Minuit, purchased the much larger Manhattan Island from the natives for 60 guilders in trade goods such as tools,
                    farming equipment, cloth and wampum.
                    Fewer than 300 people lived in New Amsterdam when the settlement moved to Manhattan. But it grew quickly,
                    and in 1760 the city (now called New York City; population 18,000) surpassed Boston to become the second-largest city in the American colonies. Fifty years later, with a population 202,589, it became the largest city in the Western hemisphere.

                        New York City is composed of five boroughs: The Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island.
                        Each borough is coextensive with a respective county of New York State.
                        The boroughs of Queens and the Bronx are also Queens County and Bronx County.
                        The other three counties are named differently from their boroughs: Manhattan is New York County, Brooklyn is Kings County, and Staten Island is Richmond County.
                        All five boroughs came into existence with the creation of modern New York City in 1898, 
                        when New York County, Kings County, part of Queens County, and Richmond County were consolidated within one municipal government under a new City Charter. All former municipalities within the newly consolidated city were eliminated.

                    <p><h3>Fun fact: New York City served as the capital of the United States from 1785 to 1790.</h3></p>

                    At the turn of the 20th century, New York City became the city we know today.
                    In 1895, residents of Queens, the Bronx, Staten Island and Brooklyn–all independent cities at that time–voted to “consolidate” with Manhattan to form a five-borough “Greater New York.” As a result, on December 31, 1897, New York City had an area of 60 square miles and a population of a little more than 2 million people; on January 1, 1898, when the consolidation plan took effect, New York City had an area of 360 square miles and a population of about 3,350,000 people.
                    The 20th century was an era of great struggle for American cities, and New York was no exception. The construction of interstate highways and suburbs after World War II encouraged affluent people to leave the city, which combined with deindustrialization and other economic changes to lower the tax base and diminish public services. This, in turn, led to more out-migration and “white flight.” However, the Hart-Cellar Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 made it possible for immigrants from Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America to come to the United States.
                    Many of these newcomers settled in New York City, revitalizing many neighborhoods.

                    On September 11, 2001, New York City suffered the deadliest terrorist attack in the history of the United States when a group of terrorists crashed two hijacked jets into the city’s tallest buildings: the twin towers of the World Trade Center.
                    he buildings were destroyed and nearly 3,000 people were killed. In the wake of the disaster, the city remained a major financial capital and tourist magnet, with over 40 million tourists visiting the city each year.
                    Today, more than 8 million New Yorkers live in the five boroughs–more than one-third of whom were born outside the United States.
                    Thanks to the city’s diversity and vibrant intellectual life, it remains the cultural capital of the United States.
